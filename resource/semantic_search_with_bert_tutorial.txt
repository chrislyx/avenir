This tutorial is for semantic search with BERT pre trained trasformer model. it provides
some tensor similarity functions to perform experiment.

Setup
=====
You need to have Spacy and PyTorch installed. You can refer to  spacy document for installing transformer
https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-transformers

I installed from this URL directly. It's a big download, about 400 MB
https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg-2.3.0/en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg-2.3.0.tar.gz 


Executing search
================
./ssearch <sim_algo>

sim_algo is the similarity algorithm to be used. Choices are as follows

ds: 	doc avrage similarity
tsma: 	token max similarity
tsavm: 	token average of max similarity
tsmav: 	token max of average similarity
tsa: 	token average similarity
tsme: 	token median similarity
ssa: 	sentence average similarity
ssme: 	sentence median similarity
ssma: 	sentence max similarity

Corpus
======
Only a smal corpus has been used. All text is hard coded in the python script. You probably 
want to change the script so that you can load your corpus from some external storage e.g file 
system or database
