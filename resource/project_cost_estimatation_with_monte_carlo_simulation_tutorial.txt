This tutorial is for calculating various statistical parameters for a project cost estimate using 
Monte Carlo Simulation python library in avenir. 

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  and ../mlextra directory with all the python files wrt where pccb.py is

Run simulator
=============
./pccb.py 5000

where 5000 is the number of iterations. You could choose a different number

For different use case
======================
You have to implement the application in python using pccb.py as an example. Please
refer to the blog post for more details
