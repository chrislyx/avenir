This tutorial is for causal inference for supply chain manufacturing back order using PyTorch


Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib   ../mlextra and ../supv directories with all the python files wrt 
where back_order.py is. You need to have PyTorch installed. All parameters are defined in 
tnn_bo.properties file. Make changes as necessary

Generate Data
=============
./back_order.py simu <num_recs> > bord_tr.txt
where
num_recs = number of records with weekly data e.g. 1000

Train neural network model
==========================
./back_order.py train tnn_bo.properties

if you want trained model check pointed make sure following parameters are  set  
common.model.directory=./model/tnn
common.model.file=bo.mod
train.model.save=True
 
Infer 
=====
./back_order.py infer 0,1000

The last argument is list of back order quantities. Make sue the following parameter is set 
it will output expected per unit profit for te 2 back order quantities
