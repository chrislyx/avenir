This tutorial is for optimum meeting schedules for meetings in week using genetic algorithms, given 
the number of meetings  and participants in those meeting. More fragmented the the free blocks of time
in betwwen higher the cost in the optimizer.


Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib   ../mlextra  directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where mesched.py is. All parameters are defined in  mesched.properties file. Make changes as 
necessary

Running the iptimizer
=====================
./mesched.py mesched.properties <num_meetings> <num_people> 

num_meetings = number of ameetings in a week e.g. 15
num_people = number of people people e.g. 10

Make sure the following configuration is set as below
opti.solution.size=x
where x = 3 * num_meetings
