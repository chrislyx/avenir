This tutorial is for product price optimization using deep reinforcement  learning using 
RLlib and TensorFlow

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib   directory with all the python files wrt where pccb.py is. You need to
have ray and tensorflow installed. ray has RLlib. If you want to use PyTorch instead, you should 
have it installed.

All the important parameters are defined in the beginning of price_rl.py. Please feel free to
change them and experiment

Train 
=====
./price_rl.py train <num_iter> <checkpoint_dir>

num_iter = num of iteration e.g. 50 
checkpoint_dir = checkpoint directory to save e.g ./model/price

Restore check pointed model and train incrementally
===================================================
./price_rl.py inctr  <checkpoint_file_path> <num_iter> <checkpoint_dir>

checkpoint_file_path = checkpoint file path e.g ./model/price/checkpoint_50/checkpoint-50
num_iter = num of iteration e.g. 30 
checkpoint_dir = checkpoint directory to save e.g ./model/price

Restore check pointe model and get action
=========================================
./price_rl.py loact  <checkpoint_file_path>

checkpoint_file_path = checkpoint file path e.g ./model/price/checkpoint_80/checkpoint-80
