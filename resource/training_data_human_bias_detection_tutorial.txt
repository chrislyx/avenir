This tutorial is for detecting and measuring human bias in job cand idate short listing data,
which is planned to be used to builda predictive model

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../mlextra directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where intvw.py is. 

Generate data
=============
./intvw.py gen <nsamp>  <noise> > intvw.txt
nsamp = num of samples e.g 2000
noise = noise level e.g. 0.1

Add human bias 
./intvw.py bias intvw.txt <bias> > intvwb.txt
bias = bias level e.g. 40

Sample executions
=================
extended lift
./intvw.py elift intvwb.txt n 1

contrasted lift
./intvw.py clift intvwb.txt n 1

odds lift
./intvw.py olift intvwb.txt n 1

conditional contrasted lift
./intvw.py clift intvwb.txt f 1

proxy extended lift
./intvw.py pelift intvwb.txt n 1
